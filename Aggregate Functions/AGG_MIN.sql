SELECT MIN(downloads) FROM fake_apps;

Similar to MAX(), SQL also makes it easy to return the smallest value in a column by using the MIN() function.

MIN() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument and returns the smallest value in that column. Here, we pass downloads as an argument so it will return the smallest value in the downloads column.
